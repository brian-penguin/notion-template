# Notion Templating

Every day I work, I create a new notion doc with the title being todays current date like
```
Tuesday October 19 2021
```

I then fill it with a quick "how I'm feeling" section, a personal todo list, and a work todolist. Sometimes I will add other random thoughts and or ideas around stuff that's not quite formulated enough to deserve it's own page. Sometimes I will reference linked other pages and want those to be there.

### What this is
This is a script that's going to do some of that daily templating for me. It should be able to:
- [] Create a new page with the date as the title
- [] Populate the weather (this would be cool to do dynamically based on my location but first pass is my default work location)
- [] Start the two todo lists I use most
- [] A dumb quote or tweet or something stupid in my timeline
